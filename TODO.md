# TODO List for Architect MCP/Discord App

## Core MCP Integration

- Develop MCP server resource definitions for Discord entities (categories, channels, roles, permissions).
- Implement MCP request handlers to create, update, delete Discord server elements.
- Develop MCP tools for advanced operations like bulk updates, audit log access, and message sending.
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization within MCP communications.

## Discord Bot Features

- Extend Discord bot message handlers to interpret and route commands to MCP server.
- Implement Administrator privilege checks for command execution.
- Support conversational interaction through mentions and replies.
- Develop fallback and error handling for invalid commands or unauthorized users.

## Command and Event Handling

- Create slash commands for basic and administrative server actions (start with /help).
- Expand event handlers to monitor server changes and sync MCP state.
- Implement logging for all admin actions initiated through AI.

## AI & Natural Language Processing

- Integrate AI models (e.g., OpenAI) for understanding user intents.
- Map natural language commands into MCP protocol requests.
- Implement conversational context maintenance for multi-step interactions.

## Security & Permissions

- Enforce Administrator-only access for all AI commands.
- Validate MCP requests to prevent unauthorized operations.
- Secure storage and usage of tokens and credentials.

## User Experience

- Provide clear help and feedback messages.
- Support localization and multi-language responses.
- Handle edge cases such as conflicting commands or partial failures gracefully.

## Deployment & Maintenance

- Finalize systemd service files and deployment scripts.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for MCP server and Discord client health.
- Automate testing pipelines for commands, events, and MCP handlers.

## Documentation

- Maintain developer documentation on MCP resource schemas and command usage.
- Provide user guides for server admins interacting with Architect.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for DMs with restricted commands or read-only info.
- Enable integration with external data sources via MCP.
- Build dashboard UI to visualize server state and command logs.
- Support for multi-server management from a single bot instance.
